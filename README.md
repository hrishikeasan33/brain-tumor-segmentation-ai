# ðŸ§  Advanced Brain Tumor Segmentation & Localization

An open-source AI framework for automated brain tumor segmentation, localization, and statistical analysis using MRI data. Powered by Attention U-Net, this system detects tumors, identifies their anatomical location, estimates severity and area, and allows mask export in real-time through a Gradio interface.

## ðŸ§© Dataset and Preprocessing

We used open-source neuroimaging data (MRI) and processed it with the following pipeline:

Steps involved:
- Normalized pixel intensities  
- Applied affine transforms for augmentation  
- Removed blank masks  
- Resized images to 128Ã—128 resolution

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

The core model is an **Attention U-Net**. Here's how the architecture and output flow works:

Key components:
- Attention gates for focus on tumor regions  
- Pixel-wise segmentation  
- Overlays + heatmaps  
- Bounding box and quadrant label inference

## ðŸ“Š Statistical Analysis

We performed hypothesis testing between **true tumor areas** and **predicted tumor areas**:
